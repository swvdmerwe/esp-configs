YAML configurations for Geyserwise and other ESPHome devices


This project is being developed with the assistance of Steve, my trusted AI powered by ChatGPT. Steve helps me structure and refine the ESPHome configuration for Geyserwise controllers, ensuring that everything is scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain. With Steve's help, I’m able to document and automate smarter — from local testing to remote deployment across sites.
